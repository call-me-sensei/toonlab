# The 15 live ToonLab Labs

ToonLab ships fifteen user-facing Labs. Each Lab edits one portable artifact
that can be saved, reopened, used through MCP, and consumed through a documented
runtime entry point. Preview cameras, stages, lights, playback, and comparison
helpers are not saved unless the Lab documentation explicitly says otherwise.

## Rock generation choices

Rock Lab provides two clear starting paths:

1. **Procedural generation without a physical template.** Choose a procedural
   shape preset and edit every generator stage.
2. **Template-based procedural generation.** Choose one of the 480 physical
   templates in the Stylized rock catalog as the starting mesh, then reshape,
   surface, compose, and export it through the same editor.

Selecting a template loads that GLB as editable source geometry. It is not a
request to generate an unrelated rock and it does not describe the catalog as
a collection of generated variations.

## Documentation from a Lab

Open **Help → Documentation** in any Lab to jump directly to its detailed
workflow, editable controls, preview-only state, saved artifact, and runtime.
MCP users can call `list_live_labs` and `get_lab_features` for the same product
boundary in machine-readable form.

## Availability boundary

Only the Labs in this document are part of the public OSS Labs surface.
Examples elsewhere in the repository demonstrate integration; they are not
additional Labs and do not create additional saved artifact contracts.
