// Nova Promenade — background and midground architectural mass (§10.1).
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS
//   Every building in the scene EXCEPT the four hero blocks. §10.1 names four
//   (ARCH-CITY-01..04) plus one unnamed "secondary skyline mass"; the
//   art-direction parity analysis measured ~30 distinct masses in the
//   benchmark plate `01-city-street-vehicles.png`. This module authors 28.
//
// WHAT IT IS BUILT FROM
//   `src/buildinggen` — the shipped seeded shape grammar. Nothing here is a
//   procedural box (§2): every volume comes out of `resolveBuildingPlan` ->
//   `meshBuildingPlan`, which produces leaning wall pairs, a stone base
//   course, per-bay pilaster/floor-band articulation, recessed window frames
//   with glass thickness and sills, doors with frames and thresholds, roof
//   slabs with undersides, fascia and gable infill, and a buried foundation
//   skirt. Read `docs/deficiencies-0.4.19.md` D19-037 for the honest limits.
//
// HOW A CITY COMES OUT OF A VILLAGE GRAMMAR
//   buildinggen's *schema ranges* are village-scale (width <= 14 m, 6 floors)
//   but `createBuildingSettings` only clamps `floors`, `roof.kind` and
//   `footprint.kind` — width, depth, floorHeight, pitch and the window
//   dimensions pass through unclamped (D19-038). So one volume reaches
//   ~30 x 20 m and ~24 m tall, and a city mass is a deliberate COMPOSITION of
//   1..4 such volumes: podium + setback tower, ziggurat, courtyard U, party-
//   wall twin, corner tower. Roof pitch driven to 0.05..0.12 gives the flat
//   roof-with-a-fall that modern architecture wants, without inventing a roof
//   kind the 1000-seed invariant suite has never seen.
//
// DETERMINISM
//   Every seed in this file is an authored constant. The only randomness is
//   `mulberry32` fed from those constants. No Math.random, no Date, no
//   per-load regeneration — a precondition of the filler contract's
//   equivalence test (docs/launch-world-filler-register.md).

// metric's "how much of the frame carries information") is produced almost
// entirely by the value STEP between a pale wall and the darker mullion,
// pilaster, floor band, sill, base course and glazing sitting on it. Families

 * plates measure 214-267deg and §5.2 requires 250-270. The darkest quartile in
 * this frame is not the road, it is the SHADED SIDE OF THE ARCHITECTURE, so a

 * matter what the fill light does. Exposure does not fix it (swept 0.30-0.52:
