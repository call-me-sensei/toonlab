// Azure Headland — coastal scene assembly (launch video, §10.2).
//
// Every visible system here is a first-party ToonLab system:
//   terrain surface   createSceneSurfaceRuntime  (src/runtime/sceneSurfaceRuntime.js)
//   ground            createGroundShaderMesh     (src/ground-shader)
//   water             surface.createWaterSurface -> WaterSurface (src/water)
//   grass             surface.createGrassField   -> createCallMeSenseiGrassField
//   sky + cloud       createSkySystem            (src/sky)
//   lighting/post     createSceneStyleRuntime + CALL_ME_SENSEI_STYLE_BUNDLE
//
// Assembly order follows launch-plan/contracts/launch-world-runtime-contracts.md §10:
// surface -> ground -> water (registers its footprint) -> objects -> grass -> sky/style.
//
// NOT in this pass, by instruction — integration points are marked INTEGRATION:
//   Yua (hero character), TREE-COAST-01/TREE-CITY-01, ROCK-COAST-01/02/03,
//   ARCH-COAST-01/02. No blockout stands in for them (§2).

// DECISION (contracts §11 item 2). PASS 2 REVERSES the pass-1 choice, and the
// reason is worth recording because it is the whole coastal shadow family.
//
// Option A was hour 8.5, which the shipped `call-me-sensei` sunPath resolves to
// exactly 42.0deg. It hits §6.5's number and misses §6.5's sentence — "late-
// morning sun". Hour 8.5 sits 36% of the way from the style's hour-6 keyframe
// to its hour-13 one, so the whole rig interpolates into DAWN: sun colour
// [1, 0.71, 0.56], sky probe [0.49, 0.54, 0.69] at 0.82 energy. A dim cold
// probe with no ambient term is exactly the mechanism that renders sand cold
// and cliff shadow faces navy — the defect both the art-direction and rocks
// workstreams reported independently.
//
// Option B is taken instead: keep the hour at 10 (genuinely late morning, and
// the palette that goes with it) and reshape the sun path's height term so
// that hour lands on 42.0deg. `heightScale = 0.4219` with the other shipped
// sunPath defaults gives atan((0.4 + 0.4219 x 0.866) / 0.85) = 42.0deg.
// Only the height term moves; azimuth, orbit radius and minElevation are the
// shipped values.
export const TIME_OF_DAY = 10;
const COASTAL_SUN_HEIGHT_SCALE = 0.4219;

// Aerial perspective (§6.5 "subtle aerial perspective"; parity analysis §5.4:
// "discrete banding, not a fog ramp"). One colour drives all three recession
// systems so the bands agree across water, terrain and foliage:
//   scene.fog             -> trees, and ToonLab Water mirrors it into uSceneFog
//   water.setDistanceFog  -> the exponential term that flattens the far swell
//   ground settings.distance -> the terrain's own atmospheric tint
// Pass 1 had none of these, so the bay held full saturation to the horizon and
// got DARKER with distance while the benchmark plate gets paler.
const HORIZON = Object.freeze({
  // A pale, slightly warm haze — the coastal shadow family is violet-magenta

  // as a blue card behind a warm beach.

  // ramp, which is what §5.4 asks for.

// The Ground Shader's `distance.color` is a linear-space triplet, not an sRGB
// hex — passing the sRGB values straight through washes the far terrain lighter
// than the fog it is supposed to match.
// Sun azimuth. The shipped `call-me-sensei` sun path has `azimuthOffset: 0`,
// which puts the sun in the NORTH-WEST at this hour, i.e.
// directly behind the bay and shining into the hero lens. Every land surface
// the camera could see was its own shadow side, and with no ambient term in the
// Call Me Sensei rig (only the sun plus a cool SH probe) the cliffs rendered as
// navy blocks and the headland lost all value structure.
//
// This rotates the path so hour 10 lands the sun in the WEST-SOUTH-WEST, over
// the hero camera's shoulder. Only the azimuth moves — `elevation` is derived from
// `timeOfDay` through the untouched height terms, so the §6.5 42.0deg holds.
// Recorded as D19-064.
// Measured: the shipped path resolves az = azimuthOffset + (hour/24 - 0.5) x

  // --- Coastal lighting authoring -------------------------------------------
  //
  // §4 requires "colored shadow families" and §6.5 prescribes a single "cool

  // analysis settles it with measurements: city shadows in the benchmark run
  // 214-267deg blue-violet, beach shadows run 327-330deg violet-magenta. A
  // beach lit by the city's fill renders cold, wrong sand — which is what pass
  // 1 did. The coastal fill is therefore authored separately here.
  //
  // The mechanism matters. `shadowTint` alone is a toon-response term; the
  // thing that actually lights every N.L <= 0 surface in this rig is the SH
  // sky probe, because `ambientLight` is disabled by design. So the probe
  // colour and energy are authored too, plus `skyGroundTint` — the probe's
  // lower hemisphere, which is physically the warm bounce off 43,000 m2 of
  // sunlit sand and is the term the benchmark's luminous warm shadows are
  // made of. `skyTopTint` stays cool: that contrast is what makes the ground
