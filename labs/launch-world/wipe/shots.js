// §11 camera and shot plan — the ten launch-video shots as data, plus the
// lens/motion rig that drives a camera from them.
//
// SCOPE CHANGE 2026-08-15 — the city was cancelled, then the coast; the launch
// scene is Stillwater Garden (`launch-plan/20-stillwater-garden-scene-brief.md`),
// a compact Japanese garden. Every shot is re-sited to `garden`.
//
// Lenses, durations and motion are §11 VERBATIM and unchanged: §11 is a
// photographic plan, not a location plan, and re-siting does not alter it.
// Shots whose §11 ACTION referenced city or coastal content carry `resiting` —
// a note naming what the scene owner still has to choose. Nothing is silently
// reinterpreted, and no lens has been quietly widened to make a smaller scene
// fill the frame.
//
// The garden is ~40 x 40 m walkable with ~24 x 18 m of hero camera space, which
// bites on the two 50 mm locked shots: at 22.9 deg vertical, a wide read costs
// DISTANCE, and there is much less of it here than on a headland. S07's framing
// is therefore the tightest constraint in the plan and is solved from the lens
// (see `solveDistanceForSubjectBand`) rather than eyeballed.
//
// S07 is now the headline shot of the whole video: a whole-scene garden wipe
// flips terrain, gravel, moss, stone, trees, water, sky, cloud and Yua at once.
//
// FILL-001. This is scene-local today; the post-merge home is `src/camera/`
// beside cameraRig.js, because "give me a camera at a real focal length, and
// tell me what render policy this shot requires" is a general ToonLab need and
// not a launch-world one. See docs/launch-world-filler-register.md.
//
// LENS. §11 specifies photographic focal lengths (28/50/70/35/24/32/50/85/28/40
// mm). three.js `PerspectiveCamera.fov` is a VERTICAL angle, so a focal length
// only becomes an fov once a film gauge and an aspect ratio are known. The rig
// pins `filmGauge = 36` (full-frame horizontal) and calls three's own
// `setFocalLength`, which derives film height as `gauge / aspect`. At the §11
// master aspect of 3840x2160 that puts a 50 mm at 22.87 deg vertical — the real
// 50 mm framing, not an approximation of it. The fov is therefore RE-DERIVED on
// every resize; a fixed fov would silently change the lens with the window.
//
// A/B RENDER POLICY. §11: "physically consistent motion blur disabled during
// A/B wipes, ... stable exposure." Motion blur is a temporal accumulation, so
// the two scissored renders of one frame would carry different histories and
// the wipe would compare shading against shading-plus-smear. Exposure is shared
// by construction — the comparison never touches `toneMappingExposure` between
// the two renders — and `exposureLocked` records that a shot must not animate
// it either.
