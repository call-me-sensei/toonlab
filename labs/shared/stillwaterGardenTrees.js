// Authoring notes: launch-plan/review/tree-replacement-authoring.md
//
// Single source of truth. The review lab (labs/tree-gate1/) and the authoring
// script (scripts/stillwater-garden-trees.mjs, which measures every variant
// and emits the portable BranchTree documents) both import this file, so a
// number can never drift between what was reviewed and what was shipped.
//
// Everything here is ToonLab-owned and procedural: BranchTree for the two tree
// families, StylizedBush for the clipped azalea masses. Nothing is generated,
// nothing is imported, no credits are spent.

// Seed rule, carried over from the previous pass:
//     variantSeed = baseSeed + variantIndex * 137
// 137 is prime and is not a rational multiple of the foliage sampler's 101.3
// per-attachment stride, so no variant can alias onto another's tuft sequence.
export const GARDEN_SEED_STRIDE = 137;

// The garden's shaping bearing, as an azimuth clockwise from +Z.
//
// §2 puts the pine mass on the northern planted rise with the camera
// approaching from the south, so the stand is shaped toward the camera: pads
// open to the viewer instead of presenting their edges, and the whole group
// reads as one wind-and-shears history rather than as three unrelated trees.
// 195 deg is south-south-west, which keeps the lean across the frame rather
// than straight down the lens.
export const GARDEN_SHAPING_BEARING_DEGREES = 195;

// Zero, deliberately, and this is a finding rather than an omission.
//
// The previous pass pre-compensated the authored bow heading by a measured
// constant so a windswept stand would centre on the wind bearing. That works
// at its `gnarliness` of 0.24. It does NOT work here: at the 0.5-0.56 these
// pines need to look pruned rather than grown, the per-segment gnarl
// perturbation dominates the trunk apex, and the map from `bendDirection` to
// achieved apex bearing stops being a rotation. Measured over three attempts
// on the same three seeds, moving the authored heading by -56 deg moved the
// measured stand mean by +51 deg — the wrong way, and by a different amount
// per variant (299 / 276 / 332). Chasing a constant here would be fitting
// noise. Recorded as D19-052.
//
// What is still true and still load-bearing is that all three variants share
// one authored bow, so the family bows from one cause. Landing the STAND on
// the scene bearing is then done at placement, where the runtime guide puts
// it anyway: each document carries its own measured apex azimuth, and
// assembly yaws the instance by (bearing - measured) plus a small jitter.
// That is exact rather than approximate, and it is measured per build.
//
// Bearing is measured on the trunk APEX, not the crown centroid. The centroid
// is the obvious metric and the wrong one once pad pruning is active: a
// sparse, farthest-point-sampled subset of tips swings the crown's centre of
// mass by tens of degrees for reasons unrelated to the trunk, which produced a
// 63 deg phantom error and a 300 deg scatter before the metric was changed.

 *
 * Two shipped preset values have to be overridden per scene, both measured
 * and photographed in this pass (D19-049, D19-050):
 *
 *   foliage.styleColorStrength — ships at 1, which blends the asset-authored
 *     canopy palette all the way into the style's own dark green. At 1 the
 *     autumn maple renders GREEN on its sun-struck crown with the authored
 *     red surviving only on the shaded underside; the canopy colour a recipe
 *     author writes has essentially no authority. The field's own description
 *     calls it "legacy aggregate-only" and the deprecation table names
 *     `tree.canopyColor` as its replacement, so the shipped 1 is the outlier.
 *     0.35 keeps the style's value grading — which is real and worth having,
 *     the crown is noticeably deeper and less poster-like than at 0 — while
 *     letting the authored hue through.
 *
 *   bark.shadowFloor / skyFillStrength — the preset's 0.42/0.04 is authored
 *     for a trunk seen against sky. On a tips-placement tree the bare limbs
 *     cross the tree's OWN crown, and a 3 cm twig turned away from the sun
 *     lands near black and reads as a crack scribbled over the foliage.
 *
 * Both are scene-side overrides on purpose. Changing the shipped preset would
 * silently recolour every tree, grass clump and flower in every other scene.
