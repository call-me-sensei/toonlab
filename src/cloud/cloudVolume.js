// The volumetric cloud raymarcher.
//
// A screen-space pass: 128 primary steps along the view ray through a spherical
// shell, 6 light steps toward the sun at every non-empty sample. Both counts
// come from src/sky/skyQualityTiers.js and are fixed for every quality tier —
// tiers scale how many *rays* are marched (cloudHistoryDiv, see
// cloudReprojection.js), never the steps per ray, because changing the step
// count changes the transmittance integral and therefore the look.
//
// Written from the published literature summarized in docs/sky-cloud-parameters.md:
//
//   Schneider & Vos, "The Real-Time Volumetric Cloudscapes of Horizon Zero
//     Dawn" (SIGGRAPH 2015) — the shell, the weather-map/height-gradient/
//     base-shape/erosion density recipe, the cone-spread light march.
//   Hillaire, EGSR 2020 / SIGGRAPH 2015 — the energy-conserving segment
//     integral and the analytic aerial-perspective solution.
//   Bruneton & Neyret 2008 — the transmittance parameterisation this reuses
//     through src/sky/atmosphereScattering.js.
//
// Geometry. Everything is world-space metres, but the shell is spherical, so
// altitudes have to survive a planet radius of 6360 km in float32. Two
// conditioned forms do that and are used everywhere instead of the direct
// expressions:
//
//   altitude(camera + d) = (camAlt + d.y) + (d.x^2 + d.z^2) / (2R + camAlt + d.y)
//   mu(after distance t) = (r*mu + t) / rAfter
//
// The first is `|p - centre| - R` rearranged so no term is ever the difference
// of two planet-scale numbers; at 42 km horizontal it reproduces the 139 m of
// earth curvature to within 1.5 mm (measured, not estimated). The direct form
// loses about a metre in float32, which is a third of a percent of a 2800 m
// shell — and it loses it at the horizon, where the melt window lives.
//
// The planet is re-centred under the camera every frame, at
// `(cameraX, groundLevel - R, cameraZ)`. That is what keeps the horizon at the
// right distance wherever the host places the camera; a centre fixed at
// `(0, -R, 0)` would leave a camera 100 km out from the world origin 780 m below
// its own local horizon. Two consequences to know about. Altitude is measured
// from the observer, so a distant cloud's height fraction drifts as the camera
// moves — 0.035 over 35 km at the default shell, absorbed entirely by the height
// gradient's plateau, so the density does not move with it. And the cloud *field*
// is still world-anchored: every noise and coverage lookup uses the absolute
// world position, so flying toward a cloud approaches it. Only the altitude and
// the horizon-bank distance are camera-relative, and both are camera-relative by
// definition. `cloudReprojection.js` re-centres identically from the same camera,
// which is what keeps the two passes agreeing within a frame.
//
// Output. `vec4(scatteredRadiance, transmittance)` in linear HDR, in the same
// unit as `sun.intensity`. The compositor's job is
// `sky * transmittance + scatteredRadiance` — no tonemap and no exposure here,
// exactly as the sky dome leaves them to the post chain.

 * But three caches that function's GENERATED TEXT in a map keyed by
 * (backend, Fn) which outlives every build, and hands the cached text to any
 * later build of the same Fn. The text does not travel. It reads its uniforms as
 * `object.nodeUniformN` — N being the slot the generating build happened to
 * allocate — and names its texture and sampler bindings the same way; and
 * because a cached body is never regenerated, its bindings are never
 * re-registered either. Handed to a build whose graph numbered the object group
 * differently, `position - cameraPosition` becomes `vec3<f32> - vec2<f32>`
 * (measured: WGSL "no matching overload for 'operator - (vec3<f32>,
 * vec2<f32>)'", GLSL "wrong operand types"), and the three noise volumes'
 * samplers are not declared in the program at all.
 *
 * That is not a corner case. `SkySystem.cloudShadow` puts this module's reduced
 * density field into an arbitrary receiver material's graph, `cloudReprojection`
 * marches into its own target, the env-map bake wants its own build with its own
 * march settings, and any material-level change rebuilds the pass in place.
 * Whichever program compiles second gets the first one's text.
 *
 * Explicit parameters are the fix for the uniforms and cannot be the fix for the
 * volumes: WGSL and GLSL both need a texture and its sampler as bindings, and
 * neither node builder maps a `texture`/`texture3D` layout input to a parameter
 * type — there is no such parameter to pass. So the function is made to belong
 * to its build instead. Every body then names the slots of the build it is
 * emitted into, whatever else that build put in the object group and in whatever
 * order, and a uniform or volume added to the field later is covered without
 * anyone having to remember this.
 *
 * The key is `builder.globalCache`: one object per NodeBuilder, and — unlike
 * `builder.cache`, which is swapped out and back around every sub-build — the
 * same object for the whole of that build. Asserted rather than defaulted: a
 * key that failed to identify the build would hand the same build two functions
 * carrying one layout name, which is a duplicate GPU identifier and a far worse
 * failure than the one this exists to prevent.

 *     sits. `powderNode` keys on it; see `cloudLighting.js` for why the plain
 *     density is the wrong input for a term that darkens *edges*.
 *
 * One call, three results.
 *
 * `sampleCoarseDensityNode(worldPosition)` returns density alone from a reduced
 * field: base shape and coverage, no erosion volume and no curl. That is the
 * shape Nubis marches the light with, and the reason is cost — the light march
 * evaluates a density six times per lit sample, so a full-detail field there
 * costs 24 texture fetches against 12 for the reduced one. The high-frequency
 * erosion carves edges finer than the light march's own 42 m first step can
 * resolve, so what it buys in a shadow is noise rather than detail.
 *
 * GPU layouts prevent the 128 view samples and their light samples from
 * inlining duplicate copies of the field. The returned `...Node` functions are
 * small call shims that can safely be used by separate shader graphs.
 *
 * The recipe, in the order the two noise modules document it:
 *
 *   heightGradient = bottomFade * topFade
 *   shape          = remap(baseShape.r, -(1 - lowFreqFbm), 1, 0, 1) * heightGradient
 *   coverage       = weather.r * (shape.coverage + horizonBank)
 *   density        = remap(shape, 1 - coverage, 1, 0, 1) * coverage
 *   density       -= baseWeatherCarve                       (thin bottoms)
 *   density       -= erosionModifier * strength * (1 - density)
 *
 * Two coordinate frames are in play and mixing them up is not a subtle error.
 * Every noise and coverage lookup uses the **absolute world position**, so the
 * cloud field is anchored to the world and a camera that flies a kilometre
 * actually approaches the cloud it was pointed at. Only three quantities are
 * camera-relative, and each of them is camera-relative by definition: the
 * conditioned altitude, which is expressed as an offset from the camera to stay
 * out of planet-scale arithmetic; the horizontal distance the horizon bank
 * builds over; and nothing else. Feeding `delta` to the noise instead pins the
 * whole sky to the camera — the clouds slide along with it and the temporal
 * reprojection, which projects a world position, disagrees with the marcher
 * about where they are.
