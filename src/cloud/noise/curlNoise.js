// Curl noise — the divergence-free vector field that advects cloud edges into
// wisps. Displacing a sample position by an arbitrary noise vector pumps
// density in and out of the cloud (the field has sources and sinks), so edges
// bulge and pop. The curl of a vector potential is divergence-free by
// construction, so advecting along it shears and folds the cloud without
// creating or destroying any of it — the reason curl noise, not plain noise, is
// what makes a wisp look torn from the body rather than pasted onto it.
//
// Potential: three decorrelated periodic Perlin FBM fields. Curl: collocated
// central differences of those. Because the same difference stencil is used for
// every partial, the mixed second derivatives cancel exactly and the discrete
// divergence is zero to floating-point rounding — not just to O(h²).
//
// Encoding: the volume packs curl * 0.5 + 0.5 into RGB and the vector's length
// into A, so a shader can modulate wisp strength by field energy from the same
// fetch. Decode through decodeCurlNoise(), or take the ready-made advection
// offset from curlNoiseOffsetNode(), rather than unpacking by hand; the scale
// the CPU normalized by is this module's business, not the raymarcher's.
//
// Both channels share one normalization scale, so A is exactly the length of the
// vector RGB decodes to. That scale comes from the probed peak *length*, not the
// peak component: a length reaches up to sqrt(3) times its largest component, so
// normalizing by the component peak overflowed A and clipped it.
