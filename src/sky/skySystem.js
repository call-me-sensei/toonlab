// The SkySystem: the one object the whole volumetric sky hangs off.
//
// It owns the dome, the cloud subsystem and its temporal reconstruction, the
// day/night clock, and every piece of atmospheric state. Nothing below it knows
// about anything above it — the dome does not know the clouds exist, the clock
// does not know a renderer exists — so this file is where the wiring, the frame
// order, and the lifetime live.
//
// `SkySystem` is ToonLab's stable public API. Keep its names, argument order,
// and semantics backward-compatible.
//
// Two ordering rules the rest of this file exists to enforce:
//
//   1. Clouds are NOT a post stage. They are marched into a reconstruction
//      buffer by `update()` and drawn IN THE SCENE by a backdrop mesh, so opaque
//      geometry occludes them and host transparency draws over them. Only the
//      aerial-perspective fog and the god rays are post stages, and those are
//      what `applyTo` returns.
//   2. The clock owns the sun's direction whenever it is running. `applyPreset`
//      therefore lands the authored sun pose with the clock momentarily paused
//      (see the comment there) — otherwise a preset's `sun.elevation` would be
//      overwritten by the celestial solve before it could ever be read back, and
//      `toParams()` would not be the inverse of `applyPreset` that it claims.
//
// NOT BUILT YET, and honest about it rather than silently absent:
//
//   - The env-map bake (src/sky/skyEnvironment.js). Asking for it throws a
//     message naming the module, because handing back a dead env map is worse
//     than refusing.
//
// The night sky IS built, in src/sky/nightSky.js, and it is the one backdrop
// this file adds CONDITIONALLY: `sky.nightSky` is documented as null when no
// `nightSky` option was supplied, so a daylight-only host pays for no extra
// sphere. Everything about it beyond construction, scene membership, the frame
// tick and the `nightSky.intensity` param belongs to that module.
//
// The aerial-perspective fog IS built, here, because `applyTo` is useless
// without it. It is a private method rather than an export: when
// src/sky/skyFog.js lands, `#fogNode` becomes a call into it and nothing else in
// this file changes. Nothing about the stage is exported, so there is no
// second-owner hazard of the kind the spec's module-ownership table exists to
// prevent.

   * The cloud backdrop: the reconstructed cloud image, drawn in the scene.
   *
   * A camera-centred sphere, drawn from the inside, exactly like the dome — NOT
   * a clip-space quad written through `vertexNode`. The quad is the obvious
   * construction and it does not survive a `pass(scene, camera)`: measured on
   * both backends, a full-screen quad whose vertex node writes the far plane
   * drew 640/640 pixels of a direct `renderer.render()` and 0/640 of the same
   * frame through the pass, with byte-identical WGSL and no validation error, on
   * every combination of depth test, blending, side and geometry size tried. The
   * sphere renders in both, so the layer is built the way the dome already
   * proves works.
   *
   * The sphere's radius is what the depth test compares against, so
   * `#refreshCamera` keeps it beyond any geometry a host can plausibly draw while
   * staying inside the depth buffer's usable range — see CLOUD_LAYER_FAR_FRACTION
   * for the measurement that rules out the far plane itself. Anything nearer
   * occludes the cloud, which is what "hidden behind opaque geometry" has to mean.
   * `depthWrite: false` keeps the layer out of everyone else's depth test, and it
   * draws before host transparency, so glass and particles composite over it.
   *
   * One consequence worth naming: the depth is the sphere's radius, not the
   * cloud's own distance, so a mountain 60 km out has cloud drawn over it even
   * where the cloud it hides is nearer. The marcher already computes a
   * transmittance-weighted mean cloud distance; writing that as the layer's depth
   * is the fix, and it needs the reconstruction to carry the depth through.
   *
   * Premultiplied over, not alpha blending: the marcher writes
   * `vec4(scatteredRadiance, viewTransmittance)`, and the composite the cloud
   * module documents is `sky * T + scattered`. With src.rgb = scattered and
   * src.a = 1 - T that is exactly One / OneMinusSrcAlpha, and no multiply of the
   * radiance by an alpha is needed or wanted — the radiance is already the
   * cloud's contribution to the pixel. A basic material emits
   * `vec4(diffuseColor.rgb, diffuseColor.a)` without premultiplying, so the pair
   * arrives at the blender as written.
